# json-schema-validator

JavaScript convenience adapter for (currently Themis) JSON Hyper-Schema v4 validation. 

This is a personal adapter that I, Greg Edwards (greglearns), use so that it will be easy to switch out JSON Schema Validators in the future. Currently, I'm using [Themis](https://github.com/playlyfe/themis), which has great defaults support and clear error messages.

This adapter conveniently includes the schema for JSON Schema v4 and JSON Hyper schema v4.
